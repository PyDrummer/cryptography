# Lab 18 - Cryptography

## Overview:
This is a console app that can encrypt, decrypt and crack a decryption.
"Your job will be to devise a method to encrypt a message that can then be decrypted when supplied with the corresponding key."

## Approach & Efficiency

I recalled what i had learned from Roger's code example lecture then started googling other examples of the topics not covered. Big O is O(n) for almost all the aspects of this.
